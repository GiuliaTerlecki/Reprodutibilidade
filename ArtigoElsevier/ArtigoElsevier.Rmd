  Opahs (Lampsis spp.) are large deep-water epi-mesopelagic predator fishes captured worldwide as bycatch of longline fisheries targeting large pelagic fishes. Despite the growing culinary interest leading to increasing commercial interest, several basic biological information about the species is still poorly known. This study uses stable isotope and stomach content analysis to access the diet and seasonality on the isotopic niche of the Big-eye Opah, Lampris megalopsis, and the Southern Spotted Opah Lampris australensis in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWAO). Generalized Linear Models were applied to investigate the influence of the species, sex, seasons, and furcal length on 13C and 15N isotopic compositions. 
  Significant differences were observed only for Autumn and for L. megalopsis. The isotopic niches resulted in overlapped 40% ellipses between the species. Seasonal differences for 15N in hot and cold seasons for both species related to the dynamic of the Brazilian and the Malvinas (Falkland) currents and the shift on the baseline source of nitrogen. Differences in 13C, with enriched values in the warmer season, were observed only for L. megalopsis and suggested movements to areas with depleted 15C values. Diet for both species was composed predominantly by Cephalopods and Teleost’s, followed by Crustacea, in smaller quantities. An alarming high plastic frequency of occurrence was observed in 40% of the stomachs of L. megalopsis and 31% of L. australensis. This study advances in understanding the Opah fishes feeding ecology in SWAO and provides information on community dynamics and the functional role that these species play in the structure of all marine ecosystems where they occur. Given the growing global commercial importance of Lampris spp., it is also increasingly important to know their inter and intraspecific relationships and the anthropological impacts they are suffering.

Introduction:
Opahs are large deep-water epi-mesopelagic predator fishes, generating heat with their strong pectoral fin muscles and using it to warm their heart and brain (Wegner et al., 2015). This characteristic increases its metabolism in cold-deep waters, which facilitates its movements across strong thermal gradients found in the open ocean (Polovina, 2008; Wainwright & Longo, 2017), and making these globally distributed fishes powerful swimmers (Rosenblatt & Johnson, 1976; Wegner et al., 2015). 
Recent studies have shown that the previously species addressed as Lampris guttatus were a complex of five species distributed around the globe (Hyde et al., 2014; Underkoffler et al., 2018), two of them occurring in the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWAO): L. megalopsis, a cosmopolitan species, and L. australensis, circumglobally distributed in the southern hemisphere subtropical waters (Terlecki et al., in prep.). 
Only a few studies approaching the feeding ecology of Lampris genera species have been published, including one about the diet of L. immaculatus (Jackson et al., 2000) and four comprising the species L. megalopsis (Big eye Opah) and L. incognitus (Small eye Opah), about diet composition (Choy et al., 2013), trophic level (Choy et al., 2015), plastic ingestion (Choy & Drazen, 2013, Neto et al., 2020) and biomass of predator fishes (Choy et al., 2016). Most of these studies were conducted in the North Pacific Ocean and concluded that these Opahs feed upon squids predominantly, followed by small pelagic fishes and lesser by small octopuses and crustaceans. 
The Lampris species are caught by longline fisheries around the world targeting large pelagic fishes, such as swordfish, tunas, and sharks (e.g., Hawn & Collete, 2012; Huang & Liu, 2010; Runcie, Dewar, Hawn, Frank & Dickson, 2009; Underkoffler, Luers, Hyde & Craig, 2018). In the Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWAO), longline fishing fleets from more than seven countries operate targeting swordfish Xiphias gladius, pelagic sharks (mainly blue shark Prionace glauca), and several tuna species (bigeye Thunnus obesus, yellow-fin T. albacares, and albacore T. alalunga) throughout the year (Hazin, Broadhurst, Amorim, Arfelli & Domingo, 2008; Jiménez, Domingo, Abreu & Brazeiro, 2011; Tuck, Polacheck, & Bulman, 2003) and, at least, two Opah species L. megalopsis and L. australensis are incidentally caught (Terlecki et al., in prep.). Although, little is known about the scale of the Opahs catches in the region. Two years of longline landings monitoring of just the Brazilian fishing fleets operating in the region recorded 3.6 tons in 2018 and 4.8 tons in 2019 (UNIVALI/EMCT/LEMA, 2020). Nevertheless, despite the increasing commercial interest in its capture due to the growing culinary interest in the quality of its meat (Underkoffler et al., 2014), their biology is still poorly studied, and intra and interspecific relationships are still unclear (Hyde et al., 2014, Choy & Drazen, 2013).
The term ecological niche, described by Hutchinson (1957), is a multidimensional space constituted by all the environmental characteristics allowing an organism to live, thus beings a key concept to understand how species use resources, participate in food webs, and influence their habitat (Bearhop et al., 2004). As the feeding ecology of species provides fundamental information on community dynamics and the functional role that species play in the structure of ecosystems (Braga et al., 2012), understanding trophic interactions of these organisms contributes to revealing the functioning, structuring, and energy flow on ecological niches (Newsome et al., 2007).
Studies of fish diet, feeding ecology, and food habits are commonly carried out by examining gut contents (Hynes, 1950; Hyslop, 1980). However, this technique presents some limitations, as the tendency to underestimate prey items quickly assimilated by the consumer (Chipps and Garvey, 2007)  and to overestimate slowly digesting prey taxa or hard parts (e.g., cephalopod beaks), since they will tend to remain in the stomach for an extended period (Baker et al., 2014, Hyslop, 1980). 
In contrast, stable isotope analysis provides quantitative information on both resource (bionomic) and habitat (scenopoetic) factors, commonly used to define ecological niche space, within variable periods of time (Newsome et al., 2007). The δ13C and δ15N values of consumers' tissues reflect those from their prey and offset due to the metabolic processes associated with the tissue synthesis and assimilation, often called trophic discrimination. This generates a systematic enrichment of the heavier isotope through the trophic levels greater for δ15N (2–4‰) than for δ13C (0–2‰) (DeNiro and Epstein, 1978, 1981). Therefore, δ13C values are considered adequate for estimating the influence of primary producers on the baseline of the consumer food web (Peterson and Fry, 1987), and δ15N is useful for trophic level estimation (Post, 2002). These premises were the foundation to the concept of isotopic niche proposed by Newsome et al. (2007), which is comparable to the n-dimensional space within the ecological niche, is composed since its preys and habitat directly influence the isotopic animal composition. Thus, with the information provided by δ13C and δ15N analysis, it is possible to provide information on the scenopoetic and bionomic axes as a proxy of the ecological niche of a species (Bearhop et al., 2004; Newsome et al., 2007).
Understanding the SWAO Opah fish feeding ecology will provide fundamental information on community dynamics and the functional role that this species plays in the structure of the SWAO marine ecosystem. In this study, we assessed the seasonality on the isotopic niche of L. megalopsis and L. australensis, and, in addition, we analyzed their diet, recording, inclusively some plastic ingestion.

Material e Methods:

Sampling

The Opahs were collected opportunistically between july/2018 and march/2020. Samples were taken from landings of the surface longline fleets operating in Southwest Atlantic Ocean (SWAO) in Rio Grande, RS, Brazil (Figure 1). The fishing region is in the western boundary of the Subtropical Convergence (30–36◦S) formed by the confluence of the warm and oligotrophic waters carried by the Brazilian Current and the nutrient-rich and cold subantarctic waters of the Malvinas (Falklands) Current (Garcia, 1997). From 88 individuals, furcal length (mm) was measured and sixty-one muscle samples (0.5 cm³), including 42 from L. australensis and 19 from L. megalopsis were taken for isotopic analyses. Stomachs are commonly excised at sea. From fishes obtained at hole, stomachs were collected and frozen at - 20°C until processing. 

![Figura 1](nome-da-imagem.png)

Muscle samples were rinsed with distilled water washed with a methanol and chloroform (2:1) solution in a Soxhlet reflux, for 12 hours, to remove lipids (Bligh and Dyer, 1959). The samples were than dried in an oven at 60 ◦C for 46 hours, ground to fine powder with mortar, and pestle prior to analysis. Aliquots of 0.6 – 0.7 mg of the resulting powder were placed into tin capsules for analysis using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (measurement precision of 0.1‰ for δ13C and 0.3‰ for δ15N) at the Centro Integrado de Análises of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (CIA-FURG, Brazil). Differences between sample rations and the international reference standards for carbon (Vienna Pee Dee Belenmite) and nitrogen (atmospheric air) were expressed in δ notation as parts per thousand (‰) using the equation: 
$$
\delta X (‰) = \left( \frac{R_{sample}}{R_{standard}} - 1 \right) \times 1000
$$
where X is 13C or 15N and R_sample is 13C/12C or 15N/15N from the sample and R_standard is 13C/12C or 15N/15N from the reference standard used (Peterson and Fry, 1987).
We measured the C:N ratios of each sample, and most of values was not in the expected range for pure protein (Logan et al., 2008; Post, 2002). Because lipids are depleted in 13C compared with whole organisms (Peterson and Fry 1987), we expected our samples would present a relation were as the C:N had higher values, δ13C would present smaller ones. Although, this did not happen and, as it was not possible to remake the procedures and the C:N values were all relatively high, with no outlier samples, we decided to proceed with the analysis. Initially, muscle fractions were removed from both the dorsal and ventral musculature of the animals. After comparisons, we saw that there were no significant differences in C:N ratio nor in δ13C and δ15N between body regions. Thus, we continued with the collection and analysis of tissue from the dorsal region.

Exploring influences on isotopic composition
Generalized linear models was runed with the ‘Stats’ package (R Core Team (2012), with Gaussian and Gama distributions and identic link functions, to test for differences in isotope values among Opahs. The influence of species, sex, season, and furcal length (mm) on δ13C and δ15N were tested. Statistical analyses and graphical outputs were performed in R 3.6.0 (R Core Team, 2019).

Isotopic niche 
The isotopic niche widths and overlaps were estimated by the Standard Ellipse Areas corrected for small samples sizes (SEAC) through the Stable Isotope Bayesian Ellipses in R package (SIBER; Jackson et al., 2011). This analysis incorporates the uncertainties regarding possible samples biases and small sample sizes (as the equivalent of the standard deviation of bivariate data) into the Bayesian estimation of niche metrics (Jackson et al. 2011; Syväranta et al. 2013). The ellipses were calculated containing 40% of data, whose variation in size was estimated through 104 posteriori draws (Jackson et al. 2011). Ellipses were generated for each species and for species by grouped seasons (Winter + Spring and Summer + Autumn) aiming to increase the sampling number for the ellipses construction and to represent a previous period, considering the turnover rate for the bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis) of 5.5 months (Madigan et al., 2021), as suggested by the author for Lampris spp. species, so Winter + Spring would be a representation of the cooler months in southern hemisphere and Summer + Autumn from the warmer months.
 
Stomach content
Stomachs were defrosted whole before processing. The total weight of was recorded, as well as the weight of empty stomachs after removal of the stomach bolus. Items were identified in the large groups of Crustacea, Cephalopoda, Teleostei and Plastic debris and their frequency of occurrence %FO was calculated for each species as in Brown et al. (2012):

$$
FO_i = \frac{n_i}{n}
$$
Where n_i is the number of stomachs containing is prey i and n is the total number of stomachs. Baits were identified through communication with vessel masters and by their level of digestion, being deducted from the analyses.


Results
A hundred and three opah specimens were sampled, and 88 furcal measurements were taken. Muscle samples from 61 individuals, including 42 from Lampris australensis and 19 from Lampris megalopsis were obtained in almost two years of sampling. The frequency of both species in the sampled individuals differed among the seasons (Figure 2). In the mild seasons (Spring and Autumn), the frequency of L. australensis and L. megalopsis was ~30% and ~70%, respectively. During Winter and Summer, however, the proportions are notably different between species. L. megalopsis represented about 65% of the samples in Winter and only ~4% in summer.

# Bibliography styles

Here are two sample references: @Feynman1963118 [@Dirac1953888].

By default, natbib will be used with the `authoryear` style, set in `classoption` variable in YAML and with `elsearticle-harv.bst` which is among provided style by `elsarticle` documentclass. Other available style are `elsarticle-num.bst` and `elsarticle-num-names.bst` — the first one can be used for the numbered scheme, second one for numbered with new options of natbib.sty. 

You can sets extra options with `natbiboptions` variable in YAML header. Example 
```yaml
natbiboptions: longnamesfirst,angle,semicolon
```

There are various more specific bibliography styles available at
<https://support.stmdocs.in/wiki/index.php?title=Model-wise_bibliographic_style_files>. 
To use one of these, add it in the header using, for example, `biblio-style: model1-num-names`.

## Using CSL 

If `citation_package` is set to `default` in `elsevier_article()`, then pandoc is used for citations instead of `natbib`. In this case, the `csl` option is used to format the references. Alternative `csl` files are available from <https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=elsevier>. These can be downloaded
and stored locally, or the url can be used as in the example header.
